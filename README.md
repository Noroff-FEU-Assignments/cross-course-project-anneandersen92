# Rainydays | Cross Course Project

![image](images/rainydays.png)

## Description

[Rainydays](https://rainydays-andersen.netlify.app/) is a web shop developed by me throughout my first year of the Front-end Development program at Noroff. The site has advanced in line with the course progression. By using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and headless WordPress I have created an interactive and dynamic web shop, with a responsive, tidy, and modern design.

Key features includes:
- a home page with a 'bestsellers' section displaying products in a carousel
- product specific pages consisting of content dynamically built using query string parameters
- a contact page with form validation which displays an error message if requirements are not met
- content that is managed with WordPress, and is fetched using WordPress REST API (CMS is headless)
- a simulated purchase/cart functionality
- a user-centric design responsive across different sized devices which also appeals to the target audience
